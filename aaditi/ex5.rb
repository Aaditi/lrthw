# Q: Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to
# centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements.
# Work out the math in Ruby.

inch_x = 1
cent_x = inch_x * 2.54

pound_x = 1
kilo_x = pound_x * 0.45

puts "#{inch_x} inch is = #{cent_x} cm"
puts "#{pound_x} pound is = #{kilo_x} kg"
